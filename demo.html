  <h1>What is Inflation</h1>
  <p>In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. This is usually measured using the consumer price index.</p>

<div id="section2" class="container-fluid bg-info" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h1>Cause for inflation</h1>
  <p>More jobs and higher wages increase household incomes and lead to a rise in consumer spending, further increasing aggregate demand and the scope for firms to increase the prices of their goods and services. When this happens across a large number of businesses and sectors, this leads to an increase in inflation.</p>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-success text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>Monetary policy primarily involves changing interest rates to control inflation. Fiscal policy enacted through legislative action also helps. Governments may reduce spending and increase taxes as a way to help reduce inflation.</p>
  <p>Example: Pakistan's government can reduce inflation by controlling the money supply, increasing the product supply, and avoiding monopolies. It will take a sustained and coordinated effort from the Government to control inflation in Pakistan</p>
